# Porting notes — lenovo/karatep

Accumulated device-specific knowledge for the Sailfish OS port of the Lenovo Vibe K6 Note /
Plus (`karatep`, MSM8937 / Snapdragon 430, Adreno 505), based on LineageOS 18.1 /
`hybris-18.1`.

These are working notes. Anything with a firm root cause gets promoted to its own write-up
under [`rca/`](rca/).

## Device facts

| | |
|---|---|
| Android codename | `karatep` |
| SoC | Qualcomm MSM8937, Snapdragon 430, Adreno 505 |
| Kernel | 3.18, defconfig `arch/arm64/configs/karatep_defconfig` |
| Android base | LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11), `hybris-18.1` |
| Port arch | `aarch64` (full 64-bit userspace) |
| Sailfish OS | 5.1.0.11 (Pispala) |
| Display pixel ratio | **1.6** |
| boot partition | `/dev/mmcblk0p34` |
| system partition | `/dev/mmcblk0p52` |
| userdata partition | `/dev/mmcblk0p54` |

The recovery does **not** expose Android's `by-name` symlinks, which is why the flashing
instructions use raw `mmcblk0p*` nodes.

## Fixes that are in the tree

* **`/system` must map to `/` in `fstab.qcom`.** The partition labelled `system` is really the
  Android *root* partition; the actual system lives at `/system/system`. File:
  `device/lenovo/karate-common/rootdir/etc/fstab.qcom`. (Thanks @mal)
* **Kernel bootflags go in `BoardConfig.mk`**, not the defconfig — `selinux=1` (permissive) and
  `audit=0` (silences audit spam). (Thanks @elros34 for `audit=0`)
* **SELinux files must be copied from the device's `/vendor`, never symlinked.** (Thanks @mal)
* **Sailjail needs namespaces**: `CONFIG_UTS_NS`, `CONFIG_IPC_NS`, `CONFIG_USER_NS`,
  `CONFIG_PID_NS`, `CONFIG_NET_NS`, `CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_NETBIOS_NS` in `karatep_defconfig`.
* **`CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES` is a string, not a bool.** It must read
  `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES="binder,hwbinder,vndbinder"`. Writing `=y` is silently
  discarded and the Kconfig default is used instead — it happens to be the same value, so the
  mistake is invisible until a Kconfig change drops a binder node.
* **Flattened-APEX linker spam** (`Expecting header 0x53595354 but found 0x564e4452`) — see
  [rca/vndservicemanager-libbinder.md](rca/vndservicemanager-libbinder.md). Fixed properly by
  the `karatep-patches` `system/core/0040..0042`; the older advice to "apply the linkerconfig patch" only
  addressed half of it.
* **Chromium WebView is not synced.** LineageOS' manifest links `patches/Android.mk`, which no
  longer exists upstream, leaving a dangling symlink that kills the build with
  `build/make/core/prebuilt.mk:53: error: external/chromium-webview/Android.mk: No such file
  or directory`. `manifests/local_manifests.xml` drops the project.

---

## Known-good workarounds (not yet root-caused)

* **`bluebinder` and WLAN conflict at boot.** With `bluebinder` unmasked, `wlan0` never
  appears and `modprobe wlan` reports no such device; `bluebinder` itself hangs in
  "activating". Masking `bluebinder` makes WLAN work, and Bluetooth works if the service is
  started manually after boot. Possibly related to an incorrect WLAN MAC — unconfirmed.
* **`ofono` sometimes needs `systemctl restart ofono` after boot** for RIL to come up.
* **To escape a bootloop**, create `/data/.stowaways/sailfishos/init_enter_debug2`. init then
  halts before starting systemd and telnet is available on port 2323. (Thanks @mal)

## Debugging the boot

The stock journald configuration on this rootfs destroys boot evidence:

```
Storage=volatile
RuntimeMaxUse=1M
RateLimitBurst=300
```

With anything crash-looping, `journalctl -b` and `dmesg` both wrap within ~500 s, so the first
two minutes of boot are gone by the time you look. Before debugging any boot problem:

```sh
cp /etc/systemd/journald.conf /etc/systemd/journald.conf.bak
printf '%s\n' '[Journal]' Storage=persistent SplitMode=none \
    RateLimitIntervalSec=0 RateLimitBurst=0 SystemMaxUse=300M RuntimeMaxUse=64M \
    > /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

`/system/bin/logcat` exists but is **not on `PATH`** in the debug shell. The Android-side log
is where HAL and binder errors actually land, so invoke it by full path:

```sh
/system/bin/logcat -d | grep -iE "composer|binder|servicemanager"
```

Useful one-liner to see which `libbinder` each process actually linked — the fastest way to
spot a VNDK namespace problem:

```sh
for d in /proc/[0-9]*; do p=${d#/proc/}
  grep -o "/[^ ]*libbinder\.so" /proc/$p/maps 2>/dev/null | sort -u |
    sed "s|^|$(cat /proc/$p/comm 2>/dev/null) |"
done | sort -u
```

## Still to fix

* IMS daemons (`vendor.imsrcsservice`, `vendor.ims_rtp_daemon`, `vendor.imsdatadaemon`)
  crash-loop continuously, spamming the journal.
* `hwservicemanager` retries `android.hardware.bluetooth@1.0::IBluetoothHci` every ~61 s.
* Failed systemd units: `droid-bootctl.service`, `systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service`,
  `wlan-module-load.service`. (`dev-binderfs.mount` also fails, but that is expected — binderfs
  is Linux 5.0+ and this kernel is 3.18; the legacy `/dev/{,hw,vnd}binder` nodes are correct.)
* 3.5 mm audio routing — jack is detected, audio is not routed.
* Mobile data does not work; SIM slot 2 reports "Network: Denied".
* Fingerprint (FPC 1020) unsupported.
* Cameras and RIL are flaky.
