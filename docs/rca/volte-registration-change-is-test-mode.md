# VoLTE never registers — ofono asks the modem the wrong question, then misreads the refusal

**Status: two of the three layers fixed and verified on hardware. The third is a vendor-side
blocker below ofono — see [The layer underneath](#the-layer-underneath-qcrils-qmi-imss-client)
for where this now stands.**

ofono reports `org.ofono.IpMultimediaSystem` `Registered: true` on karatep. It is not
registered. Every call — incoming and outgoing — falls back to CS and the modem drops to 2G.

Two independent defects stack up here, and they have to be separated before either can be
fixed:

1. the vendor RIL implements `requestRegistrationChange` as *IMS test mode*, not as "enable
   VoLTE", and refuses it; and
2. `ofono-binder-plugin-ext-qti` ignores the refusal and parses the zeroed payload behind it,
   which happens to decode as `REGISTERED`.

## Symptoms

- `IpMultimediaSystem.Registered = true`, `VoiceCapable = true`, `SmsCapable = true`.
- Calls take the IMS dial path (`ims:Dialing (ext)`) and the HAL accepts the dial, but the
  call CSFBs to 2G every time.
- qcril reports `IMS registered for VOIP or VT service 0` with `valid 0` on every field.

## What is actually on the wire

Captured with `ofonod -d 'qti_binder_trace,qti_binder_dump,...'`, which hexdumps the parcels:

```
imsradio0< [00000001]  4 getImsRegistrationState
imsradio0< [00000002]  7 requestRegistrationChange
  0030: 30 3a 3a 49 49 6d 73 52  61 64 69 6f 00 00 00 00
  0040: 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00       <- token 2, regState 0 (REGISTERED)

imsradio0> [00000001] 11 getImsRegistrationState
  0030: 6f 6e 73 65 00 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 02 00 00 00
                                 ^token 1  ^errorCode 2
imsradio0> [00000002]  4 requestRegistrationChange
  0030: 6f 6e 73 65 00 00 00 00  02 00 00 00 02 00 00 00
                                 ^token 2  ^errorCode 2
```

`errorCode 2` is `android.hardware.radio@1.0::RadioError::GENERIC_FAILURE`. **Both IMS calls
fail.** The reply to `getImsRegistrationState` carries a 48-byte `RegistrationInfo` buffer
(visible as three `BINDER_TYPE_PTR` objects — the struct plus its two empty strings) whose
contents are entirely zero.

### Why the failure reads as success

`ofono-binder-plugin-ext-qti` `src/qti_ims.c`:

```c
qti_ims_reg_status_response(QtiRadioExt* radio_ext, int result,
                            GBinderReader* reader, void* user_data)
{
    ...
    const QtiRadioRegInfo* info = qti_radio_ext_read_ims_reg_status_info(radio_ext, &reader_copy);
    if (!info) { ... return; }
    state = info->state;          /* result is never examined */
```

`result` — the `errorCode 2` above — is accepted as a parameter and never looked at. The
zeroed struct parses cleanly (the C layout is correct; see below), giving `state == 0`, and
`QTI_RADIO_REG_STATE_REGISTERED == 0`. So a hard failure is reported to ofono as a successful
registration.

`iface->flags` is likewise a compile-time constant
(`BINDER_EXT_IMS_INTERFACE_FLAG_VOICE_SUPPORT | ..._SMS_SUPPORT`), so `VoiceCapable` and
`SmsCapable` say nothing about the hardware either. **All three D-Bus properties are
artefacts.**

The struct layout is *not* the bug, and must not be "fixed":

| `QtiRadioRegInfo` field | offset | reply buffer |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | 0 | — |
| `error_code` | 4 | — |
| `error_message` | 8 | child buffer, length 1 (empty string) |
| `radio_tech` | 24 | — |
| `uri` | 32 | child buffer, length 1 (empty string) |
| total | 48 | main buffer length `0x30` = 48 ✓ |

The parcel's own buffer sizes and child `parent_offset`s (8 and 0x20) match the C struct
exactly. Ports where IMS does work report non-zero values through this same code — `state:2
radiotech:16` (mal, fp6) and `state:1 radiotech:15` (Mister_Magister) on the porters channel.
Ours reports `state:0 radiotech:0 error_code:0 uri: error_msg:` — every field zero or empty,
which is an unpopulated struct, not an answer.

## Why the modem refuses

The vendor side of the same transaction, from `logcat -b radio`:

```
qcril_process_event: RIL <--- QCRIL_EVT_IMS_SOCKET_REQ_IMS_REG_STATE_CHANGE(851994) --- AMSS
qcril_qmi_imss_request_set_ims_registration: has_state: 1, state: 1
qcril_qmi_imss_request_set_ims_registration: Need to change voice domain pref? No
qcril_qmi_imss_set_ims_test_mode_enabled: ims_test_mode_enabled = FALSE
qcril_qmi_imss_set_ims_test_mode_enabled: .. qmi send async res 1
qcril_qmi_ims_map_ril_error_to_ims_error: ril error 2 mapped to ims error 2
sendMessage: msg: IMS_REG_STATE_CHANGE RESP(type: 2, id: 26), error: 2
```

**`requestRegistrationChange` is wired to QMI IMSS "set IMS test mode".** It is not the call
that enables VoLTE; it is a lab hook, and this production modem rejects it. ofono asks the one
question the modem will not answer, and never asks the one it would.

Consistent with that, the modem's IMS Application service never reports anything at all:

```
qcril_qmi_imsa_is_ims_registered_for_voip_vt_service: IMS registered valid 0, Status 0
qcril_qmi_imsa_is_ims_registered_for_voip_vt_service: IMS service status valid 0
qcril_qmi_imsa_is_ims_registered_for_voip_vt_service: IMS registered for VOIP or VT service 0
```

`valid 0` means *no indication has ever arrived*, which is different from a negative answer.
The modem is not refusing to register; nothing has asked it to.

## What Android does instead

`vendor.qti.hardware.radio.ims@1.0::IImsRadio` has forty methods.
`ofono-binder-plugin-ext-qti` implements eight. Two of the ones it does not implement are the
ones Android uses to turn VoLTE on.

Transaction codes recovered from the device's own
`/system/system_ext/priv-app/ims/ims.apk` with
[`scripts/hidl-from-apk.py`](../../scripts/hidl-from-apk.py), which decodes the
`IImsRadio$Proxy` bytecode — HIDL numbers methods by declaration order, which the DEX class
layout does not preserve, but every generated proxy body ends in
`mRemote.transact(<code>, ...)`. The extraction reproduces all eight codes the plugin already
hardcodes — `setCallback=1`, `dial=2`, `getImsRegistrationState=4`, `answer=5`, `hangup=6`,
`requestRegistrationChange=7`, `setSuppServiceNotification=31`, `cancelModifyCall=40` — which
is what makes the rest trustworthy:

| code | method | in ext-qti? |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | `requestRegistrationChange` | yes — and it is the wrong call |
| 8 | `queryServiceStatus` | no |
| **9** | **`setServiceStatus`** | **no** |
| **12** | **`setConfig`** | **no** |
| 13 | `getConfig` | no |

On Android, `ims.apk` calls `setServiceStatus` (→ QMI IMSS *Set IMS Service Enable Config*) to
enable VoIP/VT per radio technology, and `setConfig` with
`CONFIG_ITEM_VOLTE_USER_OPT_IN_STATUS = 33` for provisioning. Both enum values were extracted
from the same APK, so they are this device's values, not a guess:

```
ServiceType:     SMS=0  VOIP=1  VT=2  INVALID=3
StatusType:      STATUS_DISABLED=0  STATUS_PARTIALLY_ENABLED=1  STATUS_ENABLED=2
                 STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED=3  STATUS_INVALID=4
RadioTechType:   RADIO_TECH_LTE=15  RADIO_TECH_IWLAN=20  RADIO_TECH_ANY=0
ConfigItem:      CONFIG_ITEM_VOLTE_USER_OPT_IN_STATUS=33
```

`setServiceStatus(int32_t token, ServiceStatusInfo)` — signature confirmed from the APK's
method prototypes. `ServiceStatusInfo`'s nine fields match the HIDL declaration already
quoted in ext-qti's `qti_radio_ext_types.h`, so the layout is known. (Note the C struct there
declares `hasIsValid`/`isValid` as 4-byte `gboolean` where HIDL specifies 1-byte `bool`; that
will need fixing before the struct is written rather than only read.)

## Prior art: none

The `#sailfishos-porters` archive was searched for `setConfig`, `ConfigItem`,
`VOLTE_USER_OPT_IN`, `opt_in`, `qcril_qmi_imss` and `IMS_REG_STATE_CHANGE`. **All six return
zero hits** across eleven years of logs. The channel's entire VoLTE effort — rinigus, mal and
Mister_Magister through 2025 and 2026 — goes through `requestRegistrationChange`, and the
recurring outcome is mal's "I haven't had luck getting ims registered yet"
(2025-07-26). The one success on the channel, Mister_Magister's
"AND WE GOT VOLTE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN" (2025-09-01), came from flashing a carrier MBN onto
the OnePlus 6T's EFS partition so the *modem* enabled IMS by itself — the ofono side was never
what turned it on. So the QMI IMSS config path is unexplored territory here, and there is no
prior art to follow.

## What was done

Both ofono-side defects are fixed in our fork,
[`Sailfish-on-karatep/ofono-binder-plugin-ext-qti`](https://github.com/Sailfish-on-karatep/ofono-binder-plugin-ext-qti)
(branch `hybris-18.1`, built by `scripts/build-extqti.sh`, cloned into `hybris/mw` because that
directory is not `repo`-managed):

1. **`qti_ims_reg_status_response()` now checks `result` before touching the payload.**
   Verified on hardware: `IpMultimediaSystem.Registered` reads `false`, which is the truth.
   The port no longer looks like it has working VoLTE when it does not.
2. **`setServiceStatus` is implemented** (transaction 9, response 6) and sent alongside the
   existing registration request.

Two things had to be right for qcril to accept it, and both were found by trying:

- **`accTechStatus` must not be empty.** With an empty list qcril answers `request misses some
  necessary information` and returns `GENERIC_FAILURE` — indistinguishable, from ofono's side,
  from the modem refusing. One entry naming `RADIO_TECH_LTE` gets it accepted.
- **`QtiRadioServiceStatusInfo` could never have matched a parcel.** `hasIsValid`/`isValid` are
  HIDL `bool` — one byte — but were declared `gboolean`, pushing every later field 8 bytes out
  and making the struct 72 bytes against the interface's 64. Nothing in ext-qti read or wrote
  it before, so the bug was invisible. Confirmed fixed against the wire: the request buffer is
  0x40 = 64 bytes with its two vecs at parent offsets 16 and 40.

With both in place qcril parses the request correctly and gets past validation:

```
qcril_qmi_imss_request_set_ims_srv_status: has_calltype: 1, calltype: 0
qcril_qmi_imss_request_set_ims_srv_status: has_status: 1, status: 2
```

(`status: 0` on Unregister, `2` on Register — `STATUS_ENABLED`. Both fields arrive intact.)

## The layer underneath: qcril's QMI IMSS client

The request is now well-formed, accepted and correctly parsed — and it still fails, one layer
deeper:

```
qcril_qmi_imss_request_set_ims_srv_status: .. qmi send async res 1
sendMessage: msg: IMS_SET_SERVICE_STATUS RESP(type: 2, id: 30), error: 2
```

That `qmi send ... res 1` is the same failure seen on **every** IMSS operation on this device:

| qcril call | result |
|---|---|
| `qcril_qmi_imss_set_ims_test_mode_enabled` (from `requestRegistrationChange`) | `qmi send async res 1` |
| `qcril_qmi_imss_get_client_provisioning_config` | `qmi send sync res 1` |
| `qcril_qmi_imss_request_set_ims_srv_status` (from `setServiceStatus`) | `qmi send async res 1` |

Three unrelated IMSS messages, all failing at the send. Meanwhile `qcril_qmi_nas_*` (network
registration, signal strength) and `qcril_qmi_uim_*` (SIM) work normally throughout. That
pattern says the problem is not any single message but that **qcril has no usable QMI IMS
Settings client** — which also explains why IMSA reports `valid 0` on every field: it has never
received an indication, because the IMS QMI plumbing was never established.

So the blocker has moved out of ofono entirely. The next question is why qcril's IMSS client
never comes up, given that `imsqmidaemon`, `imsdatadaemon`, `ims_rtp_daemon` and
`imsrcsservice` all run from boot and `vendor.ims.QMI_DAEMON_STATUS` is 1. Worth checking:
whether qcril's IMSS client init appears at all in a boot-time logcat, whether it needs
something the Android framework normally provides, and whether the socket `imsqmidaemon`
exposes is reachable by `rild` under Sailfish's environment. `setConfig` (transaction 12,
`CONFIG_ITEM_VOLTE_USER_OPT_IN_STATUS = 33`) is not worth implementing until this is resolved —
it is another IMSS message and would fail at the same place.

One operational note: reinstalling the plugin RPM **restarts** ofono. On one occasion the old
process took a SEGV during that restart instead of exiting cleanly; it was not reproducible on
a repeat, does not occur in normal operation or during IMS registration, and ofono comes back
either way.

## Not the causes

- **Not the RegState enum.** `REGISTERED=0, NOT_REGISTERED=1, REGISTERING=2, INVALID=3` was
  extracted from `ims.apk` and matches ext-qti exactly. rinigus's `REGISTERED=1` values are
  AIDL-only, as his own source comment says. Do not fork ext-qti for this.
- **Not a HAL version mismatch.** `/vendor/etc/vintf/manifest.xml` declares
  `vendor.qti.hardware.radio.ims@1.0::IImsRadio` with `imsradio0`/`imsradio1`, and the plugin
  connects to `@1.0` after correctly failing over from `@1.2` and `@1.1`.
- **Not the IMS daemons.** `imsqmidaemon`, `imsdatadaemon`, `imsrcsservice` and
  `ims_rtp_daemon` all run from boot and never restart; `vendor.ims.QMI_DAEMON_STATUS = 1`.
- **Not the LTE attach or the IMS PDN.** The device is registered on LTE with data working.
- **Not `persist.dbg.volte_avail_ovr`.** That property gates the *Android framework's* VoLTE
  UI, not the modem, and nothing on Sailfish reads it.
